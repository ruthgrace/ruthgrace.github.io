I got the website template from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

## Install instructions:

```
node install
```

To compile, run

```
gulp
```

Note that the CSS is done with Less, so edit the files in the less folder (instead of trying to change the CSS directly), and don't forget to recompile.
